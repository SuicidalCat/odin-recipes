    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Asian noodle dish is saucy, garlicky, and just a little spicy.
    You can control the spiciness by the amount of chili flakes you use. 
    feel free to add some veggies or top with a fried egg for an even heartier meal. 
    This may be served hot or cold, but we prefer ours hot.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons low sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon oyster sauce (optional)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon rice vinegar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon crushed red pepper chili flakes, or to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon chicken bouillon powder</li>
        <li>1 green onion, white part only, finely chopped</li>
        <li>5 ounces dry wheat noodles</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon black sesame seeds</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons neutral vegetable oil </li>
     <li>1 tablespoon sliced green onions</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Stir soy sauce, garlic, oyster sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil, chili flakes, brown sugar, chicken bouillon powder, and white part of the green onion in a small bowl. Set aside.</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in noodles and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 3 minutes or according to package directions. Drain well and leave noodles in the pot. Pour the chili-garlic sauce over the noodles, and mix well.</p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Meanwhile, heat a small dry skillet over medium heat. Add sesame seeds and toast until seeds are fragrant, about 1 minute.</p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>Heat oil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. When really hot, carefully pour over the noodle mixture, and toss until all noodles are evenly coated.</p>
    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <p>Taste and adjust seasonings, if necessary. To serve, divide noodles between two bowls, and garnish with green onion slices and toasted sesame seeds.</p>
